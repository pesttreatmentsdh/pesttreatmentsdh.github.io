The pest management industry is big, with over 15,000 companies serving the public and roughly 150,000 pest control service personnel. Cockroaches, mosquitoes, ants, rodents, termites, rats, wasps, insects, lizards, mice, spiders, yellow jackets, flies and bees are typically discovered pests in our society.</p>
<p>An extensive knowledge of basic IPM concepts and various management choices for all possible pest issues is essential as some are preventive and others are curative. We generally recommend pest control chemicals that do the job utilizing the least quantity of item. Broad spectrum pesticides (as a last hope).

Crucial files include a scope of service, pest activity reports, service reports, restorative action reports, trap layout maps, lists of authorized pesticides, pesticide use reports and applicator licenses.</p>
