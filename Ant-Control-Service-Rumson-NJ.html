<p>Biological pest control steps take advantage of the hierarchy within nature. IPM programmes preliminary job is to establish acceptable pest levels, called action thresholds, and apply controls where the thresholds are crossed. Understanding of these thresholds and dynamics of pests and natural enemies assists to avoid unneeded (chemical) interventions. Some termite control technicians even repair structural damage caused by termites.</p>
<p>16 For conventional farms IPM can decrease ecological and human exposure to hazardous chemicals, and potentially lower overall costs. IPM minimizes threats by minimizing overall pesticide usage, utilizing least dangerous pesticides when there is a shown need, and taking special protective measures to lower pesticide exposure living organisms and the environment.</p>
<p>The many varying risks from pests make it suggested for cultural heritage organizations to develop an Integrated Preventive Pest Management program for their collections and buildings. In these countries, routine use of pesticides is restricted to high value (cash) crops and, as such, IPM adoption is mainly fixated cotton, sugarcane, rice, and soybean.</p>
