<p>By means of research study and item advancement, and by sharing knowledge with farmers and growers all over the world through its network, the company is working to broaden its range of resources and tools in order to minimize making use of artificial fertilizer and pesticides in food production. The modification to continuous croppring systems over large adjacent areas has actually produced major insect-pest management and control issues.</p>
<p>Worldwide, more than 500 species of insects, termites, and spiders have established some level of pesticide resistance. Pesticides can take the type of a strong, liquid, powder or spray. Trap crops: Some cotton pests choose crops like maize, sunflower, okra (girl finger), sorghum, pigeon pea or hibiscus to cotton. IPM sees your garden and its pests as part of a larger ecosystem and handles both with the big photo in mind.</p>
<p>We are Leading Rated Pest Control Company & having lot of customers in these areas. AIPM is owned and operated by University graduates who learnt Biology and Pest Management with an emphasis on Animal Damage Management.

<p>The decision of the proper reason for pest problem (understanding pest biology) and ecology is important in manipulating the environment to the crop's benefit and to the detriment of the pest. Insecticides poisonous to many insects (broad-spectrum) will more adversely impact natural opponents than materials that are selective or narrow-spectrum for specific insect species or life phases. </p>
<p>Not all insects, weeds, and other living organisms require control. Hence, termite pest control should be done every couple of months or when a year. By producing an environment that's inhospitable to pests, you can remove their benefit and provide it to your plants. Companies often provide pest controller training programs covering pesticide application and crucial aspects of the task like handling rodents and termites.</p>
